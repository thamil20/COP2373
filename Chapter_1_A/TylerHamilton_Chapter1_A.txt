2. Prompt the user to input an integer between 1 and 4, inclusive.
3. Check if the user input is between 1 and 4, inclusive.
4. Check if there are more than 0 tickets remaining.
5. Display the amount of remaining tickets and repeat the loop.
6. After the while loop ends, the amount of buyers is displayed.
