Program Description:
This program is designed to simulate the responses of a Magic 8 Ball.

Logical Steps:
1. Create a file to hold the 8-ball responses for later use.
2. Write a list of responses into the file.
3. Open the file in read mode to read the lines of the file into a list.
4. Start a loop that repeats until the user decides to quit.
5. Prompt the user to ask a question that can be answered by yes or no.
6. Validate the user does not wish to quit.
7. Validate the user typed a question.
8. Randomly display a response to the user's question.

Variables:
1. file: Temporary variable to hold file objects.
2. magic_8_ball_responses: This list variable is used to hold any list
of responses to be displayed after being asked a question.
3. line: Temporary variable to create a list of responses from the file.
4. running: Boolean variable to turn the loop off when the user types
quit.
5. user_question: Prompt the user to ask a question and store it here.
6. response: Store a random response from the list of 8-ball responses.
